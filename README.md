##Project Description

The File Handling Utility is a Java-based console application developed as part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS under the Java Programming domain. This project focuses on implementing core file handling concepts in Java, such as creating files, writing data, reading file contents, and modifying existing files through appending new information.

The primary goal of this task was to strengthen understanding of Java’s java.io package and practical usage of classes like File, FileWriter, and Scanner. This application demonstrates how real-world systems interact with files to store and retrieve information persistently instead of relying only on temporary in-memory variables.

 What the Program Does

The application provides a simple menu-driven interface that allows the user to perform four major operations:

1️ Write to File

Creates or overwrites a text file named sample.txt.

Accepts user input from the console.

Stores the entered data inside the file.

2️ Read File

Checks whether the file exists before attempting to read it.

Displays the complete contents of the file line by line on the console.

3️ Modify (Append) File

Opens the existing file in append mode.

Adds new text without deleting the old content.

Ensures data persistence across executions.

4️ Exit Program

Terminates the application safely after closing resources.

All file operations are wrapped inside try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully and prevent crashes caused by missing files or I/O errors.
